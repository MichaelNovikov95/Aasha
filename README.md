# Couple words about this repo

Hi there. That's my first project, that have been wrote in Vue + Pinia + Express. It's not product ready app, but
in future, while my knowledge about choosen stack will become more deeper, I will push fix and make this
code more clear to understand and reusable.

# Before testing this app

Please, download https://github.com/MichaelNovikov95/aasha_server.git and run localy server on your machine
(in future I'm gonna deploy server on some host, but for now (12.06.2024) I didn't find perfect host for my goals).
UPD(13.06.2024) - server deployed on render.com. No need to run server locally
